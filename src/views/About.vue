        This todo list was built as a programming exercise. I wanted to learn how to use Vue, so I followed a tutorial and then modified
        the code to include a Firebase database and then launched it on Heroku. I plan to use it to help me remember to do things, as it is more fun than the
        reminder app on my iPhone.

export default {
